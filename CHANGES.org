* 1.0

- Generate a log in =_build/log=

- Improve the output of jbuilder, in particular don't mangle the
  output of commands when using =-j N= with =N > 1=

- Strengthen the scope of a package. Jbuilder knows about package =foo=
  only in the sub-tree starting from where =foo.opam= lives

- Versioned the jbuild format and added a first stable version.
  You should now put =(jbuilder_version 1)= in a =jbuild= file at the
  root of your project to ensure forward compatibility

- Generate meaningful versions in =META= files

- Added a few commands:
  + =runtest=
  + =install=
  + =uninstall=
  + =installed-libraries=
  + =exec=: execute a command in an environment similar to what you
    would get after =jbuilder install=

- Added support for aliases
  (#7, Rudi Grinberg)

- Added a manual

- Switched the CLI to cmdliner and added a =build= command
  (#5, Rudi Grinberg)

- Automatically generate =.merlin= files
  (#2, Richard Davison)

- Added support for compiling against multiple opam switch
  simultaneously by writing a =jbuild-worspace= file

- Search the root according to the rules described in the manual
  instead of always using the current directory
