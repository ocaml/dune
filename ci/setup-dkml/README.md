## FAQ

### What is the workflow to update the generated files?

Use the following to update the generated code:

```bash
opam update
make update-dkml
```

Of course that only works if there are updates available.

### What is the version of MSVC targeted? What is the required environment to execute the `desktop-ci-*` targets in the main `Makefile`?

There is no "target" per se. The CI machine (or your developer machine) is queried for all MSVC versions, and any versions that are known to be compatible with OCaml are used.
The precise definition is `Get-CompatibleVisualStudios` at https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-runtime-distribution/blob/main/src/windows/Machine/Machine.psm1; that package is available for common use in the central Opam repository.

The compatible versions as of 2022-11-23 are Visual Studio 2019 with
a) Windows 10 SDK (10.0.18362.0) and b) MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.25) or (v14.26).

*Advanced: Machine.psm1 has notes why other MSVC 2019 versions are not compatible with OCaml*

More importantly, just running it will show what is on the system and what Visual Studio components are missing (if any).
