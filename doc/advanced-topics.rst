This section describes some details of Jbuilder for advanced users.

META file generation
====================

Jbuilder uses ``META`` files from the `findlib library
manager <http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html>`__ in order
to interoperate with the rest of the world when installing libraries. It
is able to generate them automatically. However, for the rare cases
where you would need a specific ``META`` file, or to ease the transition
of a project to Jbuilder, it is allowed to write/generate a specific
one.

In order to do that, write or setup a rule to generate a
``META.<package>`` file in the same directory as the ``<package>.opam``
file. If you do that, Jbuilder will still generate a ``META`` file but
it will be called ``META.<package>.from-jbuilder``. So for instance if
you want to extend the ``META`` file generated by Jbuilder you can
write:

.. code:: scheme

    (rule
     ((targets (META.foo))
      (deps    (META.foo.from-jbuilder))
      (action  (with-stdout-to ${@}
                (progn
                 (cat ${<})
                 (echo blah))))))

Additionally, Jbuilder provides a simpler mechanism for this scheme:
just write or generate a ``META.<package>.template`` file containing a
line of the form ``# JBUILDER_GEN``. Jbuilder will automatically insert
its generated ``META`` contents in place of this line.

.. _custom-driver:

Using a custom ppx driver
=========================

You can use a custom ppx driver by putting it as the last library in ``(pps
...)`` forms. An example of alternative driver is `ppx_driver
<https://github.com/janestreet/ppx_driver>`__. To use it instead of
``ocaml-migrate-parsetree.driver-main``, simply write ``ppx_driver.runner`` as
the last library:

.. code:: scheme

    (preprocess (pps (ppx_sexp_conv ppx_bin_prot ppx_driver.runner)))

Driver expectation
------------------

Jbuilder will invoke the executable resulting from linking the libraries
given in the ``(pps ...)`` form as follows:

.. code:: bash

    ppx.exe <flags-written-by-user> --dump-ast -o <output-file> \
      [--cookie library-name="<name>"] [--impl|--intf] <source-file>

Where ``<source-file>`` is either an implementation (``.ml``) or
interface (``.mli``) OCaml source file. The command is expected to write
a binary OCaml AST in ``<output-file>``.

Additionally, it is expected that if the executable is invoked with
``--as-ppx`` as its first argument, then it will behave as a standard
ppx rewirter as passed to ``-ppx`` option of OCaml. This is for two
reasons:

-  to improve interoperability with build systems other than Jbuilder
-  so that it can be used with merlin

Findlib integration and limitations
===================================

Jbuilder uses ``META`` files to support external libraries. However, it
doesn't export the full power of findlib to the user, and especially
it doesn't let the user specify *predicates*.

The reason for this limitation is that so far they haven't been
needed, and adding full support for them would complicate things quite
a lot. In particular, complex ``META`` files are often hand-written and
the various features they offer are only available once the package is
installed, which goes against the root ideas jbuilder is built on.

In practice, jbuilder interpret ``META`` files assuming the following
set of predicates:

- ``mt``: what this means is that using a library that can be used
  with or without threads with jbuilder will force the threaded
  version

- ``mt_posix``: forces the use of posix threads rather than VM
  threads. VM threadws are deprecated and are likely to go away soon

- ``ppx_driver``: when a library acts differently depending on whether
  it is linked as part of a driver or meant to add a ``-ppx`` argument
  to the compiler, choose the former behavior

Classical ppx
=============

*classical ppx* refers to running ppx using the -ppx compiler option, which is
composed using Findlib. Even though this is useful to run some (usually old)
ppx's which don't support drivers, Jbuilder does not support preprocessing with
ppx this way. but a workaround exists using the `ppxfind
<https://github.com/diml/ppxfind>`_ tool.
