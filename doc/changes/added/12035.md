- New `(lang rocq)` build mode for Rocq 9.0 and later. This new mode
  is very similar to the existing `(lang coq)`, except that it doesn't
  need the `coq*` compatibility wrappers. As of today `(lang rocq)`
  doesn't support yet composed builds with Rocq itself, this will be
  added later.  `(lang coq)` is deprecated, development is frozen, and
  will be removed at some point in the future. (#12035, @ejgallego,
  @lysxia, fixes #11572)
