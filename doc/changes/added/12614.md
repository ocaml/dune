- Introduce a `(dir ..)` field on packages defined in the `dune-project`. This
  field allows to associate a directory with a particular package. This makes
  dune automatically filter out all stanzas in this directory and its
  descendants with `--only-packages`. All users are recommended to switch to
  using this field. (#12614, fixes #3255, @rgrinberg)
