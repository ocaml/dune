- Introduce `dune promotion show` command to display the contents of corrected
  files that are ready for promotion. This allows users to preview changes
  before running `dune promote`. The command accepts file arguments to show
  specific files, or displays all promotable files when called without
  arguments. (#12669, fixes #3883, @MixiMaxiMouse)
