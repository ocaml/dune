- Starting with version 3.21 of the Dune language, Dune no longer changes the
  default set of compiler warnings. For users that would like to keep the old
  behaviour, the variable `%{dune-warnings}` can be used in an `(env)` stanza in
  a top-level Dune file: `(env (dev (flags :standard %{dune-warnings})))`.
