- Introduce a new variable `$DUNE_CACHE_HOME` encompassing all dune caches,
  instead of relying only on `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` in the case of toolchains /
  git-repo / rev-store caches. `$DUNE_CACHE_ROOT` still exists and has priority,
  but might be removed in the future. (#11612, fixes #11584, @ElectreAAS)
