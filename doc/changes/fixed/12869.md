- Fix greedy version location in lang declarations. Previously, error locations for
  invalid lang versions would span multiple bytes for multi-byte UTF-8 characters,
  causing carets to appear misaligned and seemingly include the closing
  parenthesis. Now, error locations for ASCII strings show the full length (e.g.,
  "Ali" shows `^^^`), while non-ASCII strings show only the first byte (e.g., "è"
  shows `^`) to avoid multi-byte character display issues. (#12869, fixes #12806,
