- Add `enabled_if` on the `package` stanza in `dune-project` files. If this field is set,
  the expression is evaluated to determine whether to mask the package in this
  workspace. When opam file generation is enabled, this field is converted to
  a corresponding `available` expression (#12905, @rgrinbreg, @gridbugs)
