How to Configure Editors with Package Management
================================================

This documents aims to help people on how to set up their editors when using
Dune package management. The way to do so is somewhat different than using
previous approaches, thus configuration might need to be adapted.

:::{note}
This list is not exhaustive, the lack of your editor does not mean that it is
not possible to use Dune package management with the editor, we just don't have
an instruction for it yet. Feel free to submit information and updates about
your favorite editor as a [pull request to the Dune
repository](https://github.com/ocaml/dune/pulls).
