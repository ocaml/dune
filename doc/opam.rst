opam

opam_ is the official package manager for OCaml, and dune offers some
integration with it.

Invocation from opam
====================

You should set the ``build:`` field of your ``<package>.opam`` file as
follows:

::

    build: [
      ["dune" "subst"] {pinned}
      ["dune" "build" "-p" name "-j" jobs]
    ]

``-p pkg`` is a shorthand for ``--root . --only-packages pkg --profile
release --default-target @install``. ``-p`` is the short version of
``--for-release-of-packages``.

This has the following effects:

-  it tells dune to build everything that is installable and to
   ignore packages other than ``name`` defined in your project
-  it sets the root to prevent dune from looking it up
-  it silently ignores all rules with ``(mode promote)``
-  it sets the build profile to ``release``
-  it uses whatever concurrency option opam provides
-  it sets the default target to ``@install`` rather than ``@@default``

Note that ``name`` and ``jobs`` are variables expanded by opam. ``name`` expands
to the package name and ``jobs`` to the number of jobs available to build the
package.

Tests
-----

To setup the building and running of tests in opam, add this line to your
``<package>.opam`` file:

::

    build: [
      (* Previous lines here... *)
      ["dune" "runtest" "-p" name "-j" jobs] {with-test}
    ]

Generating ``opam`` files
=========================

Here's a complete example of a dune file with opam metadata specification:

.. code:: scheme

   (lang dune 1.10)
   (name cohttp)
   (source (github mirage/ocaml-cohttp))
   (license ISC)
   (authors "Anil Madhavapeddy" "Rudi Grinberg")
   (maintainers "team@mirage.org")

   (package
    (name cohttp)
    (synopsis "An OCaml library for HTTP clients and servers")
    (description "A longer description")
    (depends
     (alcotest :with-test)
     (dune (> 1.5))
     (foo (and :dev (> 1.5) (< 2.0)))
     (uri (>= 1.9.0))
     (uri (< 2.0.0))
     (fieldslib (> v0.12))
     (fieldslib (< v0.13))))

   (package
    (name cohttp-async)
    (synopsis "HTTP client and server for the Async library")
    (description "A _really_ long description")
    (depends
     (cohttp (>= 1.0.2))
     (conduit-async (>= 1.0.3))
     (async (>= v0.10.0))
     (async (< v0.12))))

Opam Template
-------------

A user may want to manually fill in some field in the opam file. In these
situations, dune provides an escape hatch in the form of a user written opam
template. An opam template must be named ``<package>.opam.template`` and should
be a syntactically valid opam file. Any field defined in this template file will
be taken as is by dune and never overwritten.

*Note* the template file cannot be generated by a rule and must be available in
the source tree.
