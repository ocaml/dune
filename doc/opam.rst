opam_ is the official package manager for OCaml, and dune offers some
integration with it.

Generating opam files
=====================

Dune is able to use metadata specified in the ``dune-project`` file to generate
``.opam`` files. To enable this integration, add the following field to the
``dune-project`` file:

.. code:: scheme

   (generate_opam_files true)

Dune uses the following global fields to set the metadata for all packages
defined in the project:

- ``(license <name>)`` - Specifies the license of the project, ideally as an identifier from the `SPDX License List <https://spdx.org/licenses/>`__

- ``(authors <authors>)`` - A list of authors

- ``(maintainers <maintainers>)`` - A list of maintainers

- ``(source <source>)`` - where the source is specified two ways:
  ``(github <user/repo>)`` or ``(uri <uri>)``

- ``(bug_reports <url>)`` - Where to report bugs. This defaults to the GitHub issue tracker if the source is specified as a GitHub repository

- ``(homepage <url>)`` - The homepage of the project

Package specific information is specified in the ``(package <package>)`` stanza.
It contains the following fields:

- ``(name <string>)`` is the name of the package. This must be specified.

- ``(synopsis <string>)`` is a short package description

- ``(description <string>)`` is a longer package description

- ``(depends <dep-specification>)`` are package dependencies

- ``(conflicts <dep-specification)`` are package conflicts

- ``(depopts <dep-specification)`` are optional package dependencies

- ``(tags <tags>)`` are the list of tags for the package

The list of dependencies ``<dep-specification>`` is modeled after opam's own
language: The syntax is as a list of the following elements:

.. code::

   op := '=' | '<' | '>' | '<>' | '>=' | '<='

   stage := :with_test | :build | :dev

   constr := (<op> <version>)

   logop := or | and

   dep := (name <stage>)
        | (name <constr>)
        | (name (<logop> (<stage> | <constr>)*))

   dep-specification = dep+


Here's a complete example of a dune file with opam metadata specification:

.. code:: scheme

   (lang dune 1.10)
   (name cohttp)
   (source (github mirage/ocaml-cohttp))
   (license ISC)
   (authors "Anil Madhavapeddy" "Rudi Grinberg")
   (maintainers "team@mirage.org")

   (package
    (name cohttp)
    (synopsis "An OCaml library for HTTP clients and servers")
    (description "A longer description")
    (depends
     (alcotest :with-test)
     (dune (and :build (> 1.5)))
     (foo (and :dev (> 1.5) (< 2.0)))
     (uri (>= 1.9.0))
     (uri (< 2.0.0))
     (fieldslib (> v0.12))
     (fieldslib (< v0.13))))

   (package
    (name cohttp-async)
    (synopsis "HTTP client and server for the Async library")
    (description "A _really_ long description")
    (depends
     (cohttp (>= 1.0.2))
     (conduit-async (>= 1.0.3))
     (async (>= v0.10.0))
     (async (< v0.12))))

Opam Template
-------------

A user may want to manually fill in some field in the opam file. In these
situations, dune provides an escape hatch in the form of a user written opam
template. An opam template must be named ``<package>.opam.template`` and should
be a syntactically valid opam file. Any field defined in this template file will
be taken as is by dune and never overwritten.

*Note* the template file cannot be generated by a rule and must be available in
the source tree.
