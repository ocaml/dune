   final yet and the configuration options are subject to change.

This stanza defines a new named package repository and attaches a source
location to it.

.. note::

   Defining a repository does not enable it in project by default. It needs to be
   enabled in a lock directory using the :doc:`/reference/dune-workspace/lock_dir`
   stanza.
