:term:`Packages <package>` are the units that are made installable.
Executables and libraries that have a ``(public_name)`` are installable,
and need to be attached to a package.

*******************************
 How Dune Knows About Packages
*******************************

Packages can be defined in two ways:

-  If a ``pkg.opam`` file is found, it signals the existence of the
   ``pkg`` package to Dune. The contents of the opam file are not
   interpreted by Dune.

-  In ``dune-project``, a ``(package)`` stanza with ``(name pkg)``
   defines the ``pkg`` package.

.. note::

   If you want to define public elements but are not interested in
   publishing to opam, it is not necessary to write empty ``*.opam``
   files. Instead, prefer declaring it in ``dune-project`` as a
   ``(package)`` with just a ``(name)``.

***********************
 Generating Opam Files
***********************

In the latter case, if ``(generate_opam_files)`` is present in
``(dune-project)``, Dune will generate ``pkg.opam`` using the metadata
in found in ``(package)`` stanzas and global fields such as
``(source)``.

.. seealso::

   :doc:`../howto/opam-file-generation`

If a ``pkg.opam.template`` file is found, the fields found in this opam
file are added to the generated file, overriding the generated ones in
case of collision. This can be used as an escape hatch to add arbitrary
opam fields.

********************
 What Dune Installs
********************

Dune will install the following files:

-  ``(library)`` stanzas which have a ``(public_name)``. The package
   name is the first component of the dot-separated public name:
   ``(public_name pkg)`` and ``(public_name pkg.sub)`` will look for a
   package named ``pkg`` to install their contents.

-  ``(executable)`` and ``(test)`` stanzas with a ``(public_name)``. The
   package to install the files in is determined by the ``(package)``
   field, which can be omitted if there is only one package.

-  ``(install)`` stanzas provide a low-level mechanism to install
   arbitrary files.

-  Following the conventions of odig_, files named ``README*``,
   ``CHANGE*``, ``HISTORY*`` and ``LICENSE*`` are installed in the
   packages defined by opam files in the same directory. These files can
   be generated by user rules, So for instance, a changelog generated by
   a user rule will be automatically installed as well.
