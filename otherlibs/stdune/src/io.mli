    on 32-bit systems.
    Overflow detection does not happen in the following cases:
    - channel is not a file (for example, a pipe)
    - if the detected size is unreliable (/proc)
    - race condition with another process changing the size of the underlying
      file.
      In these cases, an exception might be raised by [Buffer] functions. *)
