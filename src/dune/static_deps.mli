(** A simple wrapper around [Deps.t], where some dependencies are recorded as
    [rule_deps] and other as [action_deps]. Action dependencies are dependencies
    the external commands are expected to access, and rule dependencies are
    dependencies needed in order to compute the action to execute as well as its
    dependencies. *)
