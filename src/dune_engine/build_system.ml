       Memoizing such actions via [Memo] doesn't feel super useful given that we

       is because the build rule we produce on the fly creates a file whose name

(* Here we are doing a O(log |S|) lookup in a set S of files in the build
   directory [dir]. We could memoize these lookups, but it doesn't seem to be
   worth it, since we're unlikely to perform exactly the same lookup many times.
   As far as I can tell, each lookup will be done twice: when computing static
   dependencies of a [Action_builder.t] with [Action_builder.static_deps] and
   when executing the very same [Action_builder.t] with [Action_builder.exec] --
   the results of both [Action_builder.static_deps] and [Action_builder.exec]
   are cached. *)
