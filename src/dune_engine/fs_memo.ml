  (* Watch a path. You should call this function *before* accessing the file
     system to prevent possible races.

     If [try_to_watch_via_parent = true], the watcher will attempt to watch the
     path by watching its parent directory, falling back to watching the path
     directly if there is no parent. This is an optimisation that allows us to
     reduce the number of watched paths: typically, the number of directories is
     a lot smaller than the number of files. *)
  val watch : try_to_watch_via_parent:bool -> Path.Outside_build_dir.t -> unit Memo.t

  (* Invalidate a path after receiving an event from the file watcher. *)
  val invalidate : Path.Outside_build_dir.t -> Memo.Invalidation.t

  type watch_record =
    { accessed_path : Path.Outside_build_dir.t
    ; path_to_watch : Path.Outside_build_dir.t
    }

  (* CR-someday amokhov: We should try to simplify the initialisation of the
     file watcher. We probably no longer need this complexity because we no
     longer use an external process for file-watching. *)

  (* This module can be in three possible states:

     - It starts in [Waiting_for_file_watcher], accumulating [watched_record]s
       to pass them to the file watcher once it has been initialised.

     - If the file watcher turns out to be missing, the state [No_file_watcher]
       is used to indicate that there is no need to accumulate [watched_record]s.

     - [File_watcher] holds [Dune_file_watcher.t] once it has been initialised
       and all previously collected [watched_record]s have been passed to it. *)
  type state =
    | Waiting_for_file_watcher of watch_record list
    | No_file_watcher
    | File_watcher of Dune_file_watcher.t

  (* Ideally this should be an [Fdecl] instead of a mutable reference, but there
     are currently two reasons why it's not:

     - We read the workspace file before the file watcher has been initialised,
       so [init] is called after [state] is used. We accumulate [watch_record]s to
       process them when [init] is finally called.

     - There are tests that call [Scheduler.go] multiple times, therefore [init]
       can be called multiple times. Since these tests don't use the file watcher,
       it shouldn't be a problem. *)
  let state = ref (Waiting_for_file_watcher [])

  (* CR-someday aalekseyev: For [watch_path] to work correctly we need to ensure
     that the parent directory of [path] exists. That's certainly not guaranteed
     by the [Fs_memo] API, so we should do something to make it more robust, but
     I believe that is masked by the fact that we usually (always?) look at the
     source directory before looking for files in that directory.

     It might seem that the [`Does_not_exist] "fall back to the containing dir"
     trick used below can be extended to fall back all the way to the root, but
     it can't be because watching the root is not sufficient to receive events
     for creation of "root/a/b/c" -- for that we need to watch "root/a/b". *)

     It may seem weird that we are adding a watch on every invalidation of the

     the sense that we are not accumulating watches. In fact, if a path

(* We currently implement [file_exists] and [dir_exists] functions by calling
   [Fs_cache.path_stat] instead of creating separate [Fs_cache] primitives. Here
   are some reasons for doing this:

   - Semantically, this is equivalent because [Path.exists] is also implemented
     by checking that the [stat] call succeeds (see [caml_sys_file_exists]).

   - [Fs_cache.path_stat] doesn't change too often because the resulting record
     [Reduced_stats] doesn't include frequently changing fields like [mtime].
     Technically, it can still change while [file_exists] remains [false], for
     example, if the [st_kind] field changes from [S_DIR] to [S_LNK]. In this case
     Dune will restart unnecessarily, but such changes are rare, so we don't care.

   - Reusing [Fs_cache.path_stat] helps us to reduce the number of [stat] calls,
     i.e. we can do just one call to answer both [path_stat] and [file_exists].

   - Having a smaller number of primitives in [Fs_cache] is better because it
     makes it easier to think about reasons for restarting the current build and
     avoids unnecessary cache tables in [Fs_cache]. *)
