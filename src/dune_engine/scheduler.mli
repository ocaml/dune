(** Abort any on-going [Run.go], making it raise [Run.Shutdown_requested].

    To understand the exact effect of [shutdown], one needs to understand how
    fibers make progress. Fibers typically make progress by "waves". Each fiber
    runs for as long as it can until it can no longer make progress on its own.
    Typically, because it needs to wait for an external event.

    When no more fiber can progress, the scheduler waits for an external event.
    When it receives one event, it wakes up the corresponding [Fiber.Ivar.t]
    which triggers another wave of progress happens.

    When [shutdown] is called, the current wave of progress will continue its
    course until no more fiber can progress on its own. Then the scheduler will
    do a bit cleanup, such as killing with [SIGKILL] all running external
    processes and will then raise [Run.Shutdown_requested].

    Fibers that are suspended on a call such as [wait_for_process] or
    [wait_for_build_input_change] by the time [shutdown] is called will
    effectively never restart. If a fiber calls [wait_for_process] or any other
    function from this module that needs an external event to make progress, it
    will get suspended and will never restart. *)
val shutdown : unit -> unit Fiber.t

(** Cancel the current build. Superficially, this function is like [shutdown]
    in that it stops the build early, but it is different because the [Run.go]
    call is allowed to complete its fiber. In this respect, the behavior is
    similar to what happens on file system events in polling mode. *)

(** [sleep duration] wait for [duration] seconds to elapse. Sleepers

(** Wait for a build input to change. If a build input change was seen but
    hasn't been handled yet, return immediately.

    Return even for build input change that are not significant, so that RPC
    clients may observe that Dune reacted to a file change. This is needed for
    benchmarking the watch mode of Dune. *)
