(* CR-someday cmoseley: This interface isn't ideal as users will need to supply
   IDs manually, which could mean overwriting nodes or adding edges between
   non-existent nodes. However, it is currently needed for Memo to associate
   dep_nodes with nodes in this graph. It would be nice to refactor it to be
   more safe

   Another improvement would be better types for attributes. Currently, typing
   is only enforced by comparing value types when creating a node and raising if
   an attribute is inconsistent within a graph. It would be nice to enforce this
   somehow using the type system *)
