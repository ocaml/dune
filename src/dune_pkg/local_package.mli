(** Information about a local package that's relevant for package management.
    This is intended to represent local packages defined in a dune-project file
    (rather than packages in a lockdir). This is distinct from a
    [Dune_rules.Package.t] in that it's only intended to represent local
    packages. The "dune_pkg" library can't depend on "dune_rules" to avoid a
    circular dependency so this type is defined here so "dune_pkg" has a type
    it can use to represent local packages. *)

      dependency. Package constraints are de-duplicated by comparing them only
      on their syntax. *)

      that callers are forced to explicitly handle the case where there are no
