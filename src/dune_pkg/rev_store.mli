(** * The Revision Store

The revision store is a single shared bare Git repository acting as a cache for
packages and package repositories.

Git is used as a content-addressable file system. File content of both package
repositories and opam repositories live here. Having a single place
is advantageous because it saves space.

Dune is able to lookup any stored Git repository by its revision and see all
the files that exist within. Those files can then have their contents
fetched. *)

(** Resolve the revision in the given remote. The [revision] can be any
    accepted reference name, branch, tag or Sha1 by Git.

    If a reference name is resolved form the remote, the commit is fetched. If
    the revision is already present, no network I/O is performed. Returns
    [None] if the remote reports "not found". Raises a user error if the
    reference is ambigious. *)

    found". *)
