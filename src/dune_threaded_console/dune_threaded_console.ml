           afterwards checking if a finish was requested.

           If a finish was requested we exit the loop cleanly.

           We unlock our mutex and go into a time calculation. This calculation
           gets the current time and compares it with the last recorded time.
           This lets us compute the elapsed time.

           [frame_rate]. If this is the case then we can handle any pending user
           events and continue the loop as soon as possible.

           If we have not yet reached the [frame_rate] then we can handle user
           events and sleep for the remaining time. *)
