Build directory target from the command line.

  $ cat > dune <<EOF

  >   (deps (sandbox always))
  >   (targets (dir output))
  >   (action (bash "mkdir output; echo x > output/x; echo y > output/y")))

  $ cat _build/default/output/x
  x
  $ cat _build/default/output/y
  y

Test that workspace-local cache works for directory targets.

  $ dune build output/x --debug-cache=workspace-local

Requesting the directory target directly works too.

  $ cat > dune <<EOF
  > (rule
  >   (deps src_x (sandbox always))
  >   (targets (dir output))
  >   (action (bash "mkdir output; cat src_x > output/x; echo y > output/y")))
  > EOF

  $ rm -rf _build
  $ echo x > src_x
  $ dune build output
  $ cat _build/default/output/x
  x
  $ cat _build/default/output/y
  y

Rebuilding works correctly.

  $ echo new-x > src_x
  $ dune build output
  $ cat _build/default/output/x
  new-x

Interaction of globs and directory targets.

  >                 "\| echo c > output/c;
  >                 "\| echo d > output/subdir/d.txt;
  >                 "\| echo e > output/subdir/e

  >   (target level2)
  >   (action (bash "echo %{deps}; ls output/subdir > level2")))
  > EOF

Note: %{deps} expands to the set of generated files that match the glob [*.txt],
however, the action currently has access to all of the paths, along with any of
the subdirectories included into the directory target.

# CR-someday amokhov: Remove the files that action didn't depend on.

  $ dune build level1
  output/a.txt output/b.txt

  $ cat _build/default/level1
  a.txt
  b.txt
  c
  subdir

Depending on a glob in a subdirectory of a directory target works too.

  $ dune build level2
  output/subdir/d.txt output/subdir/e
  $ cat _build/default/level2
  d.txt
  e

Depending on a directory target directly (rather than on individual files) works
too. Note that this can be achieved in two ways:

(1) By depending on the recursively computed digest of the directory's contents;

(2) By depending on the mtime of the directory.

Currently Dune implements (2) but we'd like to switch to (1) because it supports
the early cutoff optimisation and is also more reliable.

The [src_c] dependency is unused in the rule's action but we use it to force the
rule to rerun when needed.

# CR-someday amokhov: Right now we accept simply "output" as a dependency
# specification, which is inconsistent with the target specification. This
# should be fixed, i.e. we should require "(dir output)" instead.

  $ cat > dune <<EOF
  > (rule
  >   (deps src_a src_b src_c (sandbox always))
  >   (targets (dir output))
  >   (action (bash "\| echo running;
  >                 "\| mkdir -p output/subdir;
  >                 "\| cat src_a > output/a;
  >                 "\| cat src_b > output/subdir/b
  > )))
  > (rule
  >   (deps output)
  >   (target contents)
  >   (action (bash "echo running; echo 'a:' > contents; cat output/a >> contents; echo 'b:' >> contents; cat output/subdir/b >> contents")))
  > EOF

  $ echo a > src_a
  $ echo b > src_b
  $ echo c > src_c
  $ dune build contents
  running
  running
  $ cat _build/default/contents
  a:
  a
  b:
  b

We wait for the file system's clock to advance to make sure the directory's
mtime changes when the rule reruns. We can delete this when switching to (1).

  $ dune_cmd wait-for-fs-clock-to-advance
  $ echo new-b > src_b

  $ dune build contents
  running
  running
  $ cat _build/default/contents
  a:
  a
  b:
  new-b

Dune supports early cutoff for directory targets: it skips the second action
since the produced directory has the same contents.

  $ dune_cmd wait-for-fs-clock-to-advance
  $ echo new-cc > src_c
  $ dune build contents
  running
  $ cat _build/default/contents
  a:
  a
  b:
  new-b

Check that Dune clears stale files from directory targets.

  $ cat > dune <<EOF
  > (rule
  >   (deps src_a src_b src_c (sandbox always))
  >   (targets (dir output))
  >   (action (bash "\| echo running;
  >                 "\| mkdir -p output/subdir;
  >                 "\| cat src_a > output/new-a;
  >                 "\| cat src_b > output/subdir/b
  > )))
  > (rule
  >   (deps output)
  >   (target contents)
  >   (action (bash "echo running; echo 'new-a:' > contents; cat output/new-a >> contents; echo 'b:' >> contents; cat output/subdir/b >> contents")))
  > EOF

  $ dune build contents

Note that the stale "output/a" file got removed.
