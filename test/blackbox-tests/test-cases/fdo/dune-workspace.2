; this is a test for various ways of specifying an fdo context
; and inferring the names of these contexts from the name
; of the target executable, unless explicitly specified.

(context (default
           (fdo src/test2.exe)
               ; expected name:
               ;; (name default-fdo-test2)
           ))

; the following context is expected to cause an error
; because it has the same name as the inferred names of fdo context
(context (default
           (name default-fdo-test2)
           ))
