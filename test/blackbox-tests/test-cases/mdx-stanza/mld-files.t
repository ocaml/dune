The project has an `.mld` file that needs to be fixed. At first, we determine
that that file is not being picked up:

  $ cat > dune-project <<EOF
  > (lang dune 3.7)
  > (using mdx 0.3)
  > EOF
  $ cat > dune <<EOF
  > (mdx)
  > EOF
  > cat > needs-fixes.md <<'EOF'
  > This is a sample md file. It has some code that is invalid.
  > 
  > ```ocaml
  >    # List.map (fun x -> x * x) [(1 + 9); 2; 3; 4];;
  >    - : int list = [1; 2; 3; 8]
  > ```
  > 
  > A run of MDX should output a fixed version.
  > EOF
  $ cat > needs-fixes.mld <<EOF
  > This is a sample mld file. It has some code that is invalid.
  >  
  > {[
  >   # List.map (fun x -> x * x) [(1 + 9); 2; 3; 4];;
  >   - : int list = [1; 2; 3; 8]
  > ]}
  > 
  > A run of MDX should output a fixed version.
  > EOF
  $ dune runtest
  File "needs-fixes.md", line 1, characters 0-0:
  Error: Files _build/default/needs-fixes.md and
  _build/default/.mdx/needs-fixes.md.corrected differ.
  [1]

It did pick up the error in the `.md` file, so let's promote the fix.

  $ dune promote
  Promoting _build/default/.mdx/needs-fixes.md.corrected to needs-fixes.md.
  $ dune runtest

So the tests pass now, but it only uses the default `.md` glob for files to
process.

Let's also run the test for `.mld` files. These need to be manually passed, at
least as of mdx stanza version 0.3 and require MDX 2.3.0 at minimum.

  $ cat > dune <<EOF
  > (mdx
  >   (files needs-fixes.md needs-fixes.mld))
  > EOF
  $ dune runtest
  File "needs-fixes.mld", line 1, characters 0-0:
  Error: Files _build/default/needs-fixes.mld and
  _build/default/.mdx/needs-fixes.mld.corrected differ.
  [1]

The error in the `.mld` file was found, promoting should work and re-running
the test should succeed this time.

  $ dune promote
  Promoting _build/default/.mdx/needs-fixes.mld.corrected to needs-fixes.mld.
  $ dune runtest

The 0.4 version of the stanza adds support for `.mld` files by default, so bump
the stanza version.

  $ cat > dune-project <<EOF
  > (lang dune 3.7)
  > (using mdx 0.4)
  > EOF
  $ cat > dune <<EOF
  > (mdx)
  > EOF
  $ cat > needs-fixes.mld <<EOF
  > This is a sample mld file. It has some code that is invalid.
  >  
  > {[
  >   # List.map (fun x -> x * x) [(1 + 9); 2; 3; 4];;
  >   - : int list = [1; 2; 3; 8]
  > ]}
  > 
  > A run of MDX should output a fixed version.
  > EOF

0.4 is only supported since dune-lang 3.8, so attempting to use it should fail:

  $ dune runtest
  File "dune-project", line 2, characters 11-14:
  2 | (using mdx 0.4)
                 ^^^
  Error: Version 0.4 of the mdx extension is not supported until version 3.8 of
  the dune language.
  Supported versions of the mdx extension in version 3.7 of the dune language
  are:
  - 0.1 to 0.3
  [1]

Updating the dune-lang should make the test run.

  $ cat > dune-project <<EOF
  > (lang dune 3.8)
  > (using mdx 0.4)
  > EOF
  $ dune runtest
  File "needs-fixes.mld", line 1, characters 0-0:
  Error: Files _build/default/needs-fixes.mld and

  $ dune promote
  Promoting _build/default/.mdx/needs-fixes.mld.corrected to needs-fixes.mld.
  $ dune runtest

We also make sure that `:standard` resolves properly:

  $ cat > dune <<EOF
  > (mdx
  >   (files :standard))
  > EOF
  $ cat > needs-fixes.mld <<EOF
  > This is a sample mld file. It has some code that is invalid.

  > 
  > A run of MDX should output a fixed version.
