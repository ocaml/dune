This tests that depopts are considered optional by the solver.

  $ . ../helpers.sh
  $ mkrepo
  $ mkpkg foo
  $ mkpkg bar

We create a package that depends on foo and has an optional dependency on bar
but also a conflict with bar. This should ensure that bar is never selected by
the solver.

  Solution for .dune-solution-cache:
