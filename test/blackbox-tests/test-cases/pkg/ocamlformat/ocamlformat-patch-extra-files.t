'dune fmt' produce lock files inside "dev-tools.locks/ocamlformat" before it starts building
ocamlformat and its dependencies during the same run of the "dune fmt" command. The source tree is
loaded before the lock files are produced, this is why any 'patch' file inside
'dev-tools.locks/ocmalformat' is not copied inside the 'build' directory when a rule depends on it.

The issue was that there is a rule that depends on an 'patch' file in order to copy the file
inside '_private/default/..' directory, since the file could not be copied, the rule is not activated.
So it fails when 'dune' trying to apply the patch. After any follwing run of 'dune fmt', it works
because the 'patch' file is already present.

The issue is now fixed.


  $ . ./helpers.sh

Make a fake ocamlformat:
  $ make_fake_ocamlformat "0.1"

A patch that changes the version from "0.1" to "0.26.2":
  $ cat > patch-for-ocamlformat.patch <<EOF
  > diff a/ocamlformat.ml b/ocamlformat.ml
  > --- a/ocamlformat.ml
  > +++ b/ocamlformat.ml
  > @@ -1,6 +1,6 @@

Make the ocamlformat opam package which uses a patch:
  $ mkpkg ocamlformat "0.26.2"  <<EOF
  > build: [
  >   [
  >     "dune"
  >     "build"

  $ mkdir -p mock-opam-repository/packages/ocamlformat/ocamlformat.0.26.2/files/
  $ cp patch-for-ocamlformat.patch mock-opam-repository/packages/ocamlformat/ocamlformat.0.26.2/files/

Make a project that uses the fake ocamlformat:
  $ make_project_with_dev_tool_lockdir

The project depends on ocaml, so provide a fake ocaml package:
  $ make_ocaml_opam_pkg

The ocamlformat dev tool requires the project to be locked:
  $ dune pkg lock
  Solution for dune.lock:
  - ocaml.0.0.1

First run of 'dune fmt' is supposed to format the fail.
  $ DUNE_CONFIG__LOCK_DEV_TOOL=enabled dune fmt
  Solution for dev-tools.locks/ocamlformat:
  - ocaml.0.0.1
  - ocamlformat.0.26.2
  File "foo.ml", line 1, characters 0-0:
  Error: Files _build/default/foo.ml and _build/default/.formatted/foo.ml
  differ.
  Promoting _build/default/.formatted/foo.ml to foo.ml.
  [1]

The foo.ml file is now formatted with the patched version of ocamlformat.
  $ cat foo.ml
  formatted with version 0.26.2
