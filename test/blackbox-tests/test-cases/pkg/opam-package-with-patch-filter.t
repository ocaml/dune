We test the translation of an opam package with a patches field with a filter into a dune
lock file.

  $ . ./helpers.sh
  $ mkrepo

Make a package with a patch behind a filter
  $ mkpkg with-patch-filter <<EOF
  > patches: ["foo.patch" {switch = "foobar"}]
  > build: ["cat" "foo.ml"]
  > EOF

  $ mkdir -p $mock_packages/with-patch-filter/with-patch-filter.0.0.1/files
  $ cat >$mock_packages/with-patch-filter/with-patch-filter.0.0.1/files/foo.patch <<EOF
  > diff --git a/foo.ml b/foo.ml
  > index b69a69a5a..ea988f6bd 100644
  > --- a/foo.ml
  > +++ b/foo.ml
  > @@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
  > -This is right; the patch should never be applied.
  > +This is wrong; this patch should have been filtered out.
  > EOF

  $ solve with-patch-filter
  Solution for dune.lock:
  - with-patch-filter.0.0.1
  $ append_to_lockpkg with-patch-filter <<EOF
  > (source (copy $PWD/source))
  > EOF

The lockfile should contain the patch action with the appropriate filter. 

  $ cat ${default_lock_dir}/with-patch-filter.pkg 
  (version 0.0.1)
  
  (build
   (progn
    (when
     (= %{switch} foobar)
     (patch foo.patch))
    (run cat foo.ml)))
  (source (copy $TESTCASE_ROOT/source))

  $ mkdir source
  $ cat > source/foo.ml <<EOF
  > This is right; the patch should never be applied.
  > EOF

  $ build_pkg with-patch-filter 
  This is right; the patch should never be applied.
