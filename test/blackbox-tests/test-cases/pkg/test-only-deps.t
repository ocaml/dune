List immediate dependencies in the lockdir. This should mirror the information in dune-project.
  $ dune describe pkg list-locked-dependencies
  Dependencies of local packages locked in .dune-solution-cache
  - Immediate dependencies of local package local_1.dev
    - local_2.dev
    
  - Immediate dependencies of local package local_2.dev
    - baz.0.0.1
    - qux.0.0.1 (test only)
List transitive dependencies. Note that only immediate test-only dependencies
and their dependencies are included (not test-only dependencies of test-only
dependencies).

  Dependencies of local packages locked in .dune-solution-cache

    - qux.0.0.1 (test only)
Test that we can detect the case where a local package depends on some package
only when with-test is false. This will result in an error because the solver
is run with with-test=true so the dependency won't even be in the lockdir.

Test that we can detect the case where a local package depends on some package
with version constraints that differ depending on :with-test. This will result
in an error because the solver is ruw with with-test=true which means an
incompatible version of the dependency will be in the lockdir.
