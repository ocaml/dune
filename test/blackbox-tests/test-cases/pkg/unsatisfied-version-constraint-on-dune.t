Exercise dune solving projects with version constraints on dune that aren't
satisfied by the currently-running dune.

  $ . ./helpers.sh
  $ mkrepo
  $ add_mock_repo_if_needed

Make a project that depends on a version of dune that must be earlier than the
current version of dune:
  $ cat > dune-project <<EOF
  > (lang dune 3.0)
  > (package
  >  (name foo)
  >  (depends
  >   (dune
  >    (< 3.0))))
  > EOF

Make a mock dune package with a version that satisfies the constraint in the
project:
  $ mkpkg dune 2.0.0

Solve the dependencies:
  $ dune pkg lock 2>&1 | sed -E 's/"3.[0-9]+"/"3.XX"/'
  Error: Unable to solve dependencies for the following lock directories:
  Lock directory dune.lock:
  Couldn't solve the package dependency formula.
  Selected candidates: foo.dev
  - dune -> (problem)
      User requested = 3.21
      foo dev requires < 3.0
      Rejected candidates:
        dune.3.21: Incompatible with restriction: < 3.0
