Tests for promoting with symlink to non-existent file.

  $ cat > dune-project <<EOF
  > (lang dune 3.21)
  > EOF
  $ cp dune-project dune-workspace

  $ cat > dune <<EOF
  > (rule
  >  (with-stdout-to "x.gen"
  >   (echo "toto")))
  > (rule
  >  (alias bench)
  >  (action
  >   (diff promoted x.gen)))
  > EOF

Unset INSIDE_DUNE in order to choose the "git diff" diff algorithm. Root
detection will now be automatic so a dune-workspace file was included above.
  $ unset INSIDE_DUNE

This should fail initially but not with the "Unable to resolve symlink" error.
  $ dune build @bench
  File "promoted", line 1, characters 0-0:
  ------ /dev/null
  ++++++ x.gen
  File "/dev/null", line 1, characters 0-1:
  +|toto
  No newline at the end of x.gen
  [1]

Promotion should work
  $ dune promote
  Promoting _build/default/x.gen to promoted.

  $ cat promoted
  toto
