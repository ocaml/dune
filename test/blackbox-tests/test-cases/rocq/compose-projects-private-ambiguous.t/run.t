Testing ambiguous composition of private and public theories

1. theory `A` is public belonging to `A/dune-project`
2. theory `B` is public belong to `B/dune-project`.
2. theory `C` is public belonging to `C/dune-project` and depends on `B`.
3. theory `A` is private belonging to `C/dune-project` and depends on `C`.

Currently Dune does not detect this issue, so passes invalid flags to coqdep
which complains.
