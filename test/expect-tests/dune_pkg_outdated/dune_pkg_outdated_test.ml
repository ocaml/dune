(* Testing the oudated packages message.

   This message we give with "dune pkg outdated" needs to have the following properties
   which we will check for here.

   1. The message should be clear and concise.

   2. It should contain information about the total number of packages in the lock file.

   3. It should contain information about the number of outdated packages in the lock
   file.

   4. It should contain information about outdated transitive dependencies. By default we
   choose to show only immediate dependencies, however in the case there are outdated
   dependencies, we should go out of our way to inform the user that --transitive may
   be passed to see these. Note that when --transitive is passed, this helper message
   will no longer be displayed.

   We will begin with the 4th property and then test different combinations of transitive
   and immediate deps to assertain the satisfaction of properties 1-3.
