(* The test below sets up the following situation:

   - In the initial run, there are no dependency cycles.

   - In the second run, [base_or_summit] gets an additional dynamic dependency
     and eventually cycles back to itself.

   - In all subsequent runs, we are back to having no dependency cycles.

   The dependency chains in the new test have alternating cutoff/no-cutoff
   structure, to make sure that cycle detection can handle such cases. *)

(* In the first run, the dependency structure is: A -> B -> C -> current run.

   In the second run, it's: A -> X -> B -> X, i.e. there is a dependency cycle.

   We force the computation of A and C in parallel, and make C yield, so that B
   gets blocked waiting for C to eventually complete. As a result, during the
   restore_from_cache phase in the second run, the cycle detection algorithm
   will add the path A -> B -> C to the DAG. Then, in the compute phase, B will
   get blocked on X, adding the path A -> X -> B -> X to the DAG, thus detecting
   the cycle. If the two phases are not cleanly separated, the second path might
   get cut down to just B -> X, missing the cycle and leading to a deadlock. *)
