(** Shell-style regular expressions *)

exception Parse_error

(** Implements the semantics of shells patterns. The returned regular
    expression is unanchored by default.

    Character '*' matches any sequence of characters and character
    '?' matches a single character.
    A sequence '[...]' matches any one of the enclosed characters.
    A sequence '[^...]' or '[!...]' matches any character *but* the enclosed characters.
    A backslash escapes the following character.  The last character of the string cannot
    be a backslash.

    [anchored] controls whether the regular expression will only match entire
    strings. Defaults to false.

    [pathname]: If this flag is set, match a slash in string only with a slash in pattern
    and not by an asterisk ('*') or a question mark ('?') metacharacter, nor by a bracket
    expression ('[]') containing a slash. Defaults to true.

    [match_backslashes]: If this flag is set, a forward slash will also match a
    backslash (useful when globbing Windows paths). Note that a backslash in the
    pattern will continue to escape the following character. Defaults to
    [false].

    [period]: If this flag is set, a leading period in string has to be matched exactly by
    a period in pattern. A period is considered to be leading if it is the first
    character in string, or if both [pathname] is set and the period immediately follows a
    slash. Defaults to true.

    If [expand_braces] is true, braced sets will expand into multiple globs,
    e.g. a\{x,y\}b\{1,2\} matches axb1, axb2, ayb1, ayb2.  As specified for bash, brace
    expansion is purely textual and can be nested. Defaults to false.

    [double_asterisk]: If this flag is set, double asterisks ('**') will match slash
    characters, even if [pathname] is set. The [period] flag still applies. Default to
    true. *)
